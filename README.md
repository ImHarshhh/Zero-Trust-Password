# Zero-Trust-Password


## Purpose 

The purpose of the project is to develop a secure website that collects and manages personal details of users, with a strong emphasis on password security. The implementation includes the use of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to evaluate the strength of passwords, a secure database for storing user information, and a recommendation system to guide users towards creating strong and resilient passwords. The overall goal is to enhance user security and protect sensitive information.

## Project Scope
 -  User Registration: Collect and validate personal details during the registration process. Apply the KMP algorithm to assess the strength of user passwords. 

-  Database Management: Implement a secure database system to store user information. Ensure proper encryption and hashing techniques for sensitive data. 

-  Login System: Develop a secure login system with proper authentication measures. Implement account recovery and password reset functionalities. 

-  Password Strength Indicator: Utilize the KMP algorithm to provide real-time feedback on password strength. Integrate a visual indicator to guide users in creating strong passwords.

-  Password Recommendation System: Offer suggestions and tips to users for creating strong, unique passwords. Leverage best practices and common security guidelines for password recommendations.

- Security Measures: Implement HTTPS to secure data transmission. Regularly update and patch system components to address security vulnerabilities. Conduct periodic security audits and assessments to identify and rectify potential risks.
